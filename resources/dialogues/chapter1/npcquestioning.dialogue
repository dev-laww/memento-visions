Alex: Can I talk to you? I need to know what’s the situation here. I know that you’re in dire need of help.
Tisoy: ITS THEM!!! With their ravaging and sharp claws!!! WE! HUMANS! CAN’T! STAND! AGAINST! THEM!
Alex: Something sinister happened here, I’m sure of it. But what could’ve caused them to act aggressively like this? Hmmm… 
Alex: I know you’re terrified right now, but can you tell me something more useful to pinpoint what’s causing them to act like this?
Manny: There’s someone behind them, sort of commanding them to act in a way they usually wouldn’t. It’s like, they have a goal to achieve by using the lives of people as payment.
Alex: Hm… lives of people as payment… commanding the Aswang like they’re trained dogs… I know someone higher up who could do that. They could be doing it again tomorrow to showcase what fear is so I might as well go back ahead of time tomorrow.
