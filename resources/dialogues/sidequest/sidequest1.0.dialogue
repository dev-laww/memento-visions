Lucas: Sooo Alex, sounds like you kinda figured out what’s goin’ on 👀
Alex: The creatures out there are running rampant. It feels like they hold a grudge against me.
Lucas: Nah, they don’t hate you, fam 😭 they’re just putting you through a vibe check — tryna see if you can actually handle ‘em or if some other entity’s gonna take the throne 💀
Alex: I see...
Lucas: Here, take this. Consider it your official “how to not get wrecked by mythicals” starter pack 🔥
Lucas: You’re gonna need to slay a few of ‘em. Not outta hate — just to show you’ve got main character energy.
Alex: Understood. I’ll do what needs to be done.
Lucas: That’s what I like to hear 😤 go off, Alex. Make those creatures respect the drip.

#conditional if all quest is done =>
Lucas: Yo Alex, real talk… when’s the last time you slept? You lookin’ like you just got dragged through five boss fights back to back 💀
Alex: I’m fine. You don’t need to worry about me.
Lucas: Nahh fr, you need a nap, a snack, and maybe a therapist 😭
Alex: I’ll rest when this is over.
Lucas: Bro’s living in a cutscene 😩 iconic.
