Chief: Nice of you to finally arrive, Alejandro Gutierrez… or should I call you Alex?
- Alex is fine, Chief. Now, what do we have here?
Chief: Rumors are circulating about a vengeful spirit in this place, said to kill anyone who seeks it.
Chief: Recently, several people have gone missing around here. Speculation suggests these disappearances are connected to encounters with the spirit, but we have no concrete evidence yet.
