Description = "Alex Gutierrez investigates a mysterious area feared by locals. He finds signs of bullying—a girl's diary and a photo of tormenting students—suggesting something dark happened. A misunderstood spirit once offered kindness, but the children fled in fear and vanished. As Alex digs deeper, he encounters Aswangs and realizes the horrifying truth: the missing children were killed by these creatures. Though shaken, Alex can't help but feel intrigued by the mystery."
